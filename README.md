## Data description:

1. Data used for this project is "Birth Rates for Females by Age Group: United State", from [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Birth-Rates-for-Females-by-Age-Group-United-S/yt7u-eiyg)

2. This dataset includes birth rates for females by age group in the United States from 1940 to 2015. There are 8 female age groups, including 10-14 years, 15-29 years, 20-14 years, 30-34 years, 35-39 years, 40- 44 years and 45-49 years. Birth rate here is calculated as number of birth per 1000 female population.


## Findings

1. Birth rates in all age groups reached their peak in the 1950s and early 1960s.

  The main cause is the baby boom in the United States after World War II. Young coulples had been holding off on having babys during World War II because of the Great Depression and it was also unsafe to raise children during the war. After the war, couples were eager to have children and start a family because they feel safe again. 

2. Birth rates decreased sharply in the 1970s after abortion was legalized.


3. Birth rates in younger age groups: 15-19 years, 20-24 years has been decreasing, which is most likely due to the increasing use of contraceptive devices. On the other hand, the birth rates for women in older age groups such as 30-34 years and 35-39 years have been increasing. The main reason could be that more women are going to college and thus they tend to marry later.
