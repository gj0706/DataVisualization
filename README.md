## Data description:

1. Data used for this project is "Birth Rates for Females by Age Group: United State", from [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Birth-Rates-for-Females-by-Age-Group-United-S/yt7u-eiyg)

2. This dataset includes birth rates for females by age group in the United States from 1940 to 2015. There are 8 female age groups, including 10-14 years, 15-29 years, 20-14 years, 30-34 years, 35-39 years, 40- 44 years and 45-49 years. Birth rate here is calculated as number of birth per 1000 female population.


## Findings

1. Birth rates in all age groups reached their peak in the 1950s and early 1960s.
  The main cause is the baby boom.

2. Birth rates decreased sharply in the 1970s after abortion was legalized.


3. Birth rates in younger age groups: 15-19 years, 20-24 years has been decreasing; while increase in older age groups: 30-34 years, 35-39 years.
  The main reason could be that more women are going to college and marrying later.
